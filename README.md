# custom_table_formatter
This was my first "big" project, which was what convinced me to pursue programming. It is a Microsoft Word VBA macro that resizes and formats custom tables to a specific size and formatting. The biggest challenge was working around VBA's restriction on handling merged cells. 

Part of my job at the time involved formatting documents containing these custom tables. Often enough, these documents were 100-1000 pages and contained various lengths of tables throughout most of the document. Each document contained its own unique set of "bugs" that changed each table to weird proportions. With a lot of research and the help of the internet community, I was able to put this macro together that would fix all these problems with the click of a button.
